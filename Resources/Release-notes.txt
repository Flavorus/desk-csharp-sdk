Desk 0.0.3.0		2013-02-03
==============================

This version has a much better NuGet specification. It defines the
dependencies it has to newtonsoft.json and RestSharp.



Desk 0.0.2.0		2013-02-02
==============================

This version has changed the DeskApi class quite a bit. Instead of
a Get method, it instead has a Call method, that lets you define a
method to use when calling an API resource.

I also added a NuGet specification, but it is crippled so far. The
file will be better in the next version.



Desk 0.0.1.0		2013-02-01
==============================

This version is really an alpha alpha alpha release. I have done a
bit of major refact already, but this release should be stable for
all kind of GET requests needed. However, the SDK ony has a mapper
for a few methods in this version.
